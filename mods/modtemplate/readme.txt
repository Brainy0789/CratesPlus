Thank you for choosing to mod CRATES+!

This guide is to get your started on your journey!

- DIRECTORIES -

The "data" directory is where all levels and dialogue go. Their respective folder names is:

data/levels
data/dialogue

The "images" directory is where all images go.

The "music" directory is where all music goes.

The "sound directory is where all sounds goes.

If you want to replace an existing asset in game, you can totally do that! Just make sure it has the same name and folder name.

The "scripts" directory is where all HScript scripts go. It has two folders, "global" and "levels". 

Scripts in the "global" folder will run in every level.

Scripts in the "levels" folder will only run in the set level. Each script in the levels folder has to be in another folder called the level name.


- THE LEVEL ORDER FILE -

levelorder.txt is one of the most important files in the mod folder. It defines the order of the levels. Without it, the levels will go in numerical or alphabetical order. 

It's simple to edit. Just type the level names by order.

EXAMPLE:

Level1
Level2
Level3
...and so on.

You can find this file in data/games/My-Game/levelorder.txt
